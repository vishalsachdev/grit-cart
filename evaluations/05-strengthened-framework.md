# Grit-CART 2.0: A Strengthened Framework for Thriving in an AI-Driven World

## 1. What Works Well — Elements to Preserve

The original Grit-CART framework has several genuinely strong elements that should be kept intact:

**Theoretical grounding is the headline strength.** Unlike Lean Startup (which is practitioner-derived and largely anecdotal) or Design Thinking (which rests on limited empirical evidence for business outcomes), Grit-CART maps each trait to multiple validated psychological constructs: Big Five, SDT, grit research, critical thinking literature. This gives it scholarly credibility that most entrepreneurship frameworks lack.

**The dual-track ambition (entrepreneurship + intrapreneurship) is rare and valuable.** Most frameworks assume you are founding a startup. The explicit inclusion of intrapreneurship acknowledges that the vast majority of business students will enter existing organizations, and that innovation within organizations is where most AI-driven value creation actually occurs.

**The happiness dimension is a genuine differentiator.** Entrepreneurship education is overwhelmingly performance-oriented. By threading well-being through the framework via SDT (autonomy, competence, relatedness) and positive psychology, Grit-CART offers something most competing frameworks do not: permission to ask "will this make me fulfilled?" alongside "will this make money?"

**The CART acronym is memorable and pedagogically useful.** It provides a sequencing logic (learn, act, risk, refine) that students can internalize and apply.

**What is novel compared to existing frameworks:**

| Framework | Focus | Grit-CART Adds... |
|-----------|-------|-------------------|
| Lean Startup | Build-Measure-Learn cycle for ventures | Psychological readiness *before* the cycle begins |
| Effectuation (Sarasvathy) | Means-based reasoning under uncertainty | Explicit trait development + well-being |
| Design Thinking | Empathy-driven problem solving | Agency, risk tolerance, and long-term persistence |
| Entrepreneurial Mindset (NFTE/ICE) | Opportunity recognition | Theoretical depth via behavioral science |

## 2. The CART Ordering — Modify to a Cycle, Rename for Clarity

### Problem with the Current Ordering

The C-A-R-T sequence is presented as linear, which does not match how entrepreneurial work actually unfolds. In practice:

- You do not finish being curious before you start acting.
- Taste (judgment) is not something you apply only at the end; it shapes what you are curious about in the first place.
- Risk-taking is not a discrete phase; it is distributed across every decision.

### Proposed Modification: CARE Cycle

Rename two elements for precision and reorder into a **cycle** rather than a pipeline:

| Original | Renamed | Rationale |
|----------|---------|-----------|
| Curiosity | **Curiosity** (keep) | Clear, well-understood, maps cleanly to openness and intrinsic motivation |
| Agency | **Agency** (keep) | Strong construct; no better alternative |
| Risk-Taking | **Risk-Experimentation** (modify) | "Risk-taking" connotes gambling. Entrepreneurial practice is about structured experimentation with bounded downside. Aligns with effectuation's "affordable loss" principle and Lean Startup's MVP logic. In shorthand: just **R** for the acronym. |
| Taste | **Evaluative Judgment** (modify) | "Taste" is too subjective and aesthetic-sounding for business contexts. "Evaluative Judgment" captures the critical thinking, ethical discernment, and quality assessment Stanovich's work actually describes. In shorthand: **E** for the acronym. |

This gives us **CARE** — Curiosity, Agency, Risk-Experimentation, Evaluative Judgment.

**However**, I recognize the cost of changing the acronym. If CART has already taken hold in Vishal's teaching materials, the rename carries switching costs. A workable compromise: **keep the CART letters** but redefine what R and T stand for:

- **C** = Curiosity
- **A** = Agency
- **R** = Resourceful Experimentation (captures both risk-taking and the resourcefulness/bricolage literature)
- **T** = Thoughtful Judgment (retains the T, adds clarity over "taste")

### The Cycle Model

Rather than a linear sequence, present CART as a **cycle with re-entry**:

```
        ┌──────────────┐
        │   CURIOSITY   │ ← What don't I know? What could exist?
        └──────┬───────┘
               │
               ▼
        ┌──────────────┐
        │    AGENCY     │ ← What can I do about it right now?
        └──────┬───────┘
               │
               ▼
        ┌──────────────────────┐
        │ RESOURCEFUL          │ ← What small bet can I place?
        │ EXPERIMENTATION      │   What can I test cheaply?
        └──────┬───────────────┘
               │
               ▼
        ┌──────────────────────┐
        │ THOUGHTFUL           │ ← What did I learn? What matters?
        │ JUDGMENT             │   Should I persist, pivot, or stop?
        └──────┬───────────────┘
               │
               ▼
        ┌──────────────┐
        │   CURIOSITY   │ ← New questions emerge from judgment
        └──────────────┘
               ...cycle continues...
```

**Grit wraps the entire cycle** (see Section 3). Each pass through the cycle is one "iteration." Grit is what determines whether you complete multiple iterations rather than abandoning after the first failure.

## 3. Grit Integration — From Vague Engine to Measurable Mechanism

### The Problem

In the current framework, grit is described as an "overarching engine" and a "multiplier," but these are metaphors, not mechanisms. A student reading the framework cannot answer: *How specifically does grit operate at each stage? How do I know if I have enough? How do I build it?*

### Proposed Integration: Grit as the Persistence-Adaptation Regulator

Drawing on Duckworth's more recent work (post-2020) distinguishing between *stubborn persistence* and *strategic persistence*, define grit's role at each CART stage:

**Grit operates through two sub-processes:**

1. **Sustained Engagement** (the passion side) — Maintaining interest and emotional investment across iterations
2. **Adaptive Persistence** (the perseverance side) — Continuing effort while modifying strategy based on feedback

| CART Stage | Grit Sub-Process | What It Looks Like | Risk Without Grit |
|------------|-----------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Curiosity | Sustained Engagement | Returning to a problem domain after initial research yields confusion or dead ends | Superficial scanning; "curiosity tourism" |
| Agency | Adaptive Persistence | Taking action, getting blocked by bureaucracy or resource constraints, finding alternative paths | Learned helplessness; "I tried once and it didn't work" |
| Resourceful Experimentation | Adaptive Persistence | Running experiment #7 after experiments #1-6 failed, each time with a refined hypothesis | Premature abandonment or reckless doubling-down |
| Thoughtful Judgment | Sustained Engagement | Investing the cognitive effort to honestly evaluate results rather than confirmation-biasing toward what you want to see | Shallow post-mortems; pattern-matching to desired outcomes |

**Critical addition: Grit requires a "quit criteria" mechanism.** One of the most cited criticisms of grit theory (Credé et al., 2017) is that it can justify throwing good effort after bad. Thoughtful Judgment must include explicit "stop rules" — conditions under which persisting is no longer gritty but is instead sunk-cost fallacy. This is the *strategic* in strategic persistence.

### Growth Mindset as Cognitive Precondition

**The original framework's most significant omission is growth mindset (Dweck).** Growth mindset is not merely a complement to grit — it is the epistemic foundation that makes grit rational. The logic:

1. Grit requires sustained effort toward long-term goals.
2. Sustained effort only makes sense if you believe effort leads to improvement.
3. A fixed mindset ("I'm just not a risk-taker") makes persistence irrational — you are confirming your inadequacy.
4. A growth mindset ("risk-tolerance is a skill I can build") makes persistence the rational strategy.

**Empirical basis**: [Park et al. (2020)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8747892/) found grit and growth mindset are distinct but bidirectionally reinforcing (N=1,667, longitudinal). A [2025 meta-analysis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001691825001854) confirmed the correlation at rho=.19-.24. Critically, [Yeager et al. (2022)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8985222/) — co-authored by both Duckworth and Dweck — showed growth mindset interventions only work when the instructor also holds a growth mindset.

**How growth mindset operates at each CART stage:**

| CART Stage | Fixed Mindset Blocker | Growth Mindset Enabler |
|---|---|---|
| Curiosity | "Asking questions reveals ignorance" | "Questions are tools for learning" |
| Agency | "Outcomes are determined by talent, not effort" | "My actions can change my circumstances" |
| Experimentation | "Failure proves I lack ability" | "Failure tells me what to try next" |
| Judgment | "I either have good taste or I don't" | "My judgment sharpens through exposure and critique" |

**The most actionable finding**: [Mueller & Dweck (1998)](https://cpb-us-w2.wpmucdn.com/web.sas.upenn.edu/dist/b/398/files/2019/04/1998-04530-003-1sagefw.pdf) showed that a single sentence of intelligence praise ("You must be smart") made 67% of children choose easy tasks, while effort praise made the majority choose hard tasks. This directly affects CART pedagogy — praising students' *talent* when early ventures succeed will reduce their willingness to take future risks.

**Honest caveats**: Growth mindset effects are real but heterogeneous. [Sisk et al. (2018)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0956797617739704): ~1% of achievement variance overall. [Macnamara & Burgoyne (2023)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36326645/): d=0.05 average intervention effect. But the [2019 Nature study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1466-y) (N=12,490, pre-registered, Duckworth + Dweck co-authors) showed 0.10-0.25 SD effects for lower-achieving students in supportive peer climates. Effects are strongest for at-risk students in supportive contexts — near-zero when averaged universally.

**Proposed model for Grit-CART 2.0:**

```
Growth Mindset → Grit → CART Development → Mastery Experiences
      ↑                                            |
      +------------ reinforcing loop --------------+
```

### Making Grit Buildable

Instead of treating grit as a fixed trait, present it as a **practice with five buildable habits**:

1. **Growth mindset cultivation** — Explicitly teach that CART traits are developable, not innate (Dweck & Yeager, 2019). This is the prerequisite for the other four.
2. **Deliberate difficulty selection** — Regularly choosing tasks slightly above current ability (Ericsson's deliberate practice)
3. **Failure narration** — Writing or speaking about setbacks in a growth frame ("I learned X" rather than "I failed")
4. **Identity alignment** — Connecting effort to a self-concept ("I am someone who finishes what I start" rather than "I should finish this")
5. **Community anchoring** — Surrounding yourself with persistent peers (grit is socially contagious; Duckworth & Yeager, 2015)

### Instructor Mindset as Moderating Variable

[Yeager et al. (2022)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8985222/) demonstrated that the instructor's own mindset is not a background variable — it moderates whether student-facing interventions work at all:

- Growth-mindset teachers: student intervention produced 0.11 grade-point improvement
- Fixed-mindset teachers: zero effect (-0.02, nonsignificant)

**Implication**: If you teach Grit-CART but implicitly believe some students "have it" and others don't, students will detect the implicit theory even if the explicit messaging is growth-oriented. Dweck's concept of "false growth mindset" applies.

### Praise Principles for CART Teaching

Based on Mueller & Dweck (1998) and Dweck's own 2015 self-correction (effort praise alone is insufficient — students need strategies, not just encouragement):

| Instead of... | Say... | CART Stage |
|---|---|---|
| "You have great intuition for this" | "Your questioning strategy helped you find that insight" | Curiosity |
| "You're a real go-getter" | "I noticed you reached out to three potential users — that's effective agency" | Agency |
| "You're brave" | "Taking on that uncertainty was smart because it gave you information you couldn't get otherwise" | Experimentation |
| "You have great taste" | "Your judgment is getting sharper — I can see you're applying the criteria we discussed" | Judgment |

And when students fail at CART activities, use the **wise feedback** formula ([Yeager et al., 2014](https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/xge-a0033906.pdf)): high standards + explicit belief in the student's capacity. "This prototype didn't work, and that's exactly what's supposed to happen at this stage. Here's what I'd push you to try next, because I've seen your capacity to iterate."

---

## 4. Adding the Missing Layers — From Trait Model to Ecosystem Model

The most significant weakness of the current Grit-CART framework is that it is **purely individual and trait-based**. It tells students "be curious, be agentic, take risks, use taste" without acknowledging that traits operate within systems. A student from an under-resourced background with plenty of grit and curiosity may still fail if they lack access to networks, capital, mentors, or even reliable internet.

### Proposed: Three Surrounding Layers

Reconceptualize the framework as concentric layers, with CART traits at the center:

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│              CONTEXT LAYER                        │
│  Market conditions, institutional support,        │
│  regulatory environment, AI infrastructure access │
│                                                   │
│  ┌────────────────────────────────────────────┐   │
│  │          RELATIONAL LAYER                  │   │
│  │  Teams, mentors, networks, communities,    │   │
│  │  peer accountability, diverse perspectives │   │
│  │                                            │   │
│  │  ┌──────────────────────────────────────┐  │   │
│  │  │        CAPABILITY LAYER              │  │   │
│  │  │  Technical skills, business acumen,  │  │   │
│  │  │  AI literacy, ethical reasoning,     │  │   │
│  │  │  communication, financial literacy   │  │   │
│  │  │                                      │  │   │
│  │  │  ┌──────────────────────────────┐    │  │   │
│  │  │  │     CART TRAITS + GRIT       │    │  │   │
│  │  │  │  (Individual dispositions)   │    │  │   │
│  │  │  └──────────────────────────────┘    │  │   │
│  │  └──────────────────────────────────────┘  │   │
│  └────────────────────────────────────────────┘   │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Layer Details

#### 4a. Capability Layer (Skills)

Traits without skills are directionless. A curious person who cannot code, analyze data, or build a financial model will struggle to act on their curiosity in AI-era business contexts.

**Core capability domains for AI-era entrepreneurship/intrapreneurship:**

| Domain | Why It Matters | Minimum Threshold |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|
| **AI Literacy** | Understanding what AI can/cannot do; prompt engineering; evaluating model outputs; awareness of bias and hallucination | Can evaluate an AI tool's suitability for a business problem; can identify when AI output is unreliable |
| **Business Fundamentals** | Unit economics, customer discovery, value proposition design | Can articulate a value proposition and estimate whether a business model could be viable |
| **Ethical Reasoning** | Systemic thinking about AI impacts: privacy, bias, labor displacement, environmental cost | Can identify at least three stakeholder groups affected by an AI deployment and articulate tradeoffs |
| **Communication** | Pitching, storytelling, writing, cross-functional collaboration | Can present an idea clearly to a non-technical audience in under 3 minutes |
| **Data Reasoning** | Not statistics expertise, but comfort interpreting data, spotting misleading claims | Can read a dashboard, question its assumptions, and identify what data is missing |

**Note on ethics**: The current framework subsumes ethics under "Taste," which is insufficient. Taste is an individual aesthetic judgment; ethics requires systemic reasoning about impacts on others, communities, and ecosystems. Ethical reasoning should be a standalone capability, not a subset of personal discernment. This is especially critical for AI, where decisions about training data, deployment contexts, and automation of human roles have consequences that extend far beyond the individual decision-maker.

#### 4b. Relational Layer (Teams, Networks, Mentors)

The current framework is almost entirely solo-protagonist. Yet:

- Entrepreneurship research consistently finds that **founding teams outperform solo founders** (Wasserman, 2012)
- Intrapreneurship is inherently collaborative (you are working within an organization)
- Grit itself is socially reinforced (Duckworth has acknowledged this repeatedly)
- SDT's third need — **relatedness** — is the one most neglected in the current framework

**Components of the Relational Layer:**

1. **Team composition** — Complementary CART profiles (not everyone needs to be high on all four traits; a team should be collectively strong)
2. **Mentorship** — Access to experienced practitioners who can accelerate judgment development and provide "borrowed grit" during low points
3. **Peer networks** — Cohort-based learning groups; accountability partners; diverse perspectives that challenge blind spots
4. **Community engagement** — Connecting ventures/projects to the communities they serve (prevents building solutions for problems nobody has)

#### 4c. Context Layer (Systems and Environment)

Acknowledging that individual traits are necessary but not sufficient. This layer makes the framework honest about structural realities without becoming fatalistic.

**Key contextual factors:**

- **Market conditions**: Funding availability, customer readiness, competitive landscape
- **Institutional support**: University resources, incubators, corporate innovation programs
- **AI infrastructure access**: Compute availability, API costs, open-source model ecosystem
- **Regulatory environment**: AI governance, intellectual property, data privacy laws
- **Socioeconomic access**: Capital, networks, geographic proximity to innovation hubs

**Pedagogical approach**: Do not present context as deterministic ("you cannot succeed without X"), but as a landscape to be navigated. Agency, in the Grit-CART framework, explicitly includes the ability to reshape context — but students should learn to *assess* their context honestly before attempting to reshape it.

## 5. Making It Measurable — The Grit-CART Diagnostic

### Self-Assessment Rubric (1-4 Scale per Dimension)

Each dimension is assessed on a 4-level rubric. This can be used for self-reflection, peer assessment, or instructor evaluation of student project work.

#### Grit (Overarching)

| Level | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 1 — Fragile | Abandons goals after first significant setback. Difficulty sustaining interest beyond initial excitement. |
| 2 — Developing | Persists through minor obstacles but retreats from major ones. Interest wanes over weeks. |
| 3 — Steady | Maintains effort through multiple setbacks. Can articulate why a goal matters to them personally. Seeks help when stuck rather than quitting. |
| 4 — Resilient | Sustains effort over months or years. Adapts strategy while maintaining direction. Can distinguish between productive persistence and sunk-cost persistence. Inspires persistence in others. |

#### Curiosity

| Level | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 1 — Passive | Waits to be told what to learn. Does not explore beyond assigned materials. |
| 2 — Responsive | Follows up on interesting ideas when they appear but does not actively seek them. Asks "what" questions. |
| 3 — Active | Regularly explores adjacent domains. Asks "why" and "what if" questions. Reads, experiments, and talks to people outside their field. |
| 4 — Generative | Combines insights from multiple domains to generate novel questions. Maintains a running list of open questions. Curiosity visibly drives their project direction. |

#### Agency

| Level | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 1 — Dependent | Requires explicit instructions to take any action. Does not initiate. |
| 2 — Reactive | Acts when prompted but does not seek out opportunities. Completes tasks but does not create them. |
| 3 — Proactive | Identifies needs and acts without being asked. Seeks and marshals resources (people, tools, funding). Overcomes at least one structural barrier independently. |
| 4 — Catalytic | Mobilizes others to act. Creates new opportunities and resources where none existed. Reshapes their environment to support goals. |

#### Resourceful Experimentation

| Level | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 1 — Avoidant | Avoids uncertainty. Plans exhaustively but does not test. Treats failure as a verdict. |
| 2 — Cautious | Willing to try known approaches with minor variations. Handles expected setbacks. |
| 3 — Experimental | Designs and runs structured experiments with clear hypotheses. Comfortable with ambiguity. Iterates based on results rather than assumptions. |
| 4 — Strategic | Makes calculated bets with bounded downside. Uses "affordable loss" reasoning. Can articulate what would constitute disconfirming evidence for their hypothesis. Runs parallel experiments. |

#### Thoughtful Judgment

| Level | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 1 — Undiscerning | Accepts information at face value. Does not evaluate quality, ethics, or fit. |
| 2 — Evaluative | Can distinguish good from bad when presented with options, but does not proactively assess. |
| 3 — Discerning | Systematically evaluates options against explicit criteria. Considers ethical implications for multiple stakeholders. Seeks disconfirming evidence. |
| 4 — Integrative | Synthesizes across technical, ethical, business, and human dimensions. Can articulate tradeoffs clearly. Applies judgment consistently, not just when convenient. Makes "stop" decisions when evidence warrants. |

### Scoring and Interpretation

- **Total range**: 5-20 (across Grit + 4 CART dimensions)
- **Profile shape matters more than total score.** A student scoring 4/1/4/2/3 (high grit, low curiosity, high agency, low experimentation, moderate judgment) has a very different development path than one scoring 2/4/2/4/3.
- **Use radar charts** to visualize profiles — students respond well to visual self-assessment.
- **Administer at start and end of module** to show growth (pre-post design).

### Quick Diagnostic: 10 Questions (2 per dimension)

For a faster assessment, use these paired items (5-point Likert scale: Strongly Disagree to Strongly Agree):

**Grit:**
1. "When I commit to a long-term goal, I maintain my effort even when progress is slow or invisible."
2. "I can tell the difference between a goal worth persisting on and one I should abandon."

**Curiosity:**
3. "I regularly explore topics outside my major/job description because I find them genuinely interesting."
4. "When I encounter something I don't understand, my first reaction is to investigate rather than move on."

**Agency:**
5. "When I see a problem that affects me, I take action rather than waiting for someone else to solve it."
6. "I have successfully obtained resources (funding, help, access, tools) that were not offered to me."

**Resourceful Experimentation:**
7. "I would rather test an imperfect idea quickly than spend months perfecting a plan."
8. "When an experiment fails, I adjust my approach and try again rather than concluding the idea is bad."

**Thoughtful Judgment:**
9. "Before making a significant decision, I actively seek out information that might prove me wrong."
10. "I consider how my decisions affect people beyond my immediate circle (customers, communities, future users)."

## 6. Dual-Track Playbooks — Entrepreneurship vs. Intrapreneurship

The dual-track distinction is one of Grit-CART's best features. Here is how to develop it into actual playbooks while sharing the CART core.

### Shared Core

Both tracks use the same CART cycle and grit foundation. The differences lie in **context, constraints, and leverage points**.

### Track A: AI Entrepreneurship Playbook

| CART Stage | Key Actions | Unique Constraints | Key Questions |
|------------|-------------|-------------------|---------------|
| Curiosity | Customer discovery interviews (20+). Explore open-source AI model landscape. Study adjacent markets. | No institutional knowledge base; must build understanding from scratch. | "What problem do people have that AI can now solve 10x better or cheaper?" |
| Agency | Build an MVP in days, not months. Assemble a co-founder or early team. Apply to accelerators. Bootstrap or seek pre-seed funding. | No existing infrastructure; must create everything. | "What can I build with what I have right now?" |
| Resourceful Experimentation | Launch to real users within 4 weeks. Run pricing experiments. Test acquisition channels. Expect 90%+ failure rate on first hypotheses. | Limited runway; each experiment must be cheap and fast. "Affordable loss" (Sarasvathy) is the operating principle. | "What is the smallest experiment that could disprove my biggest assumption?" |
| Thoughtful Judgment | Evaluate product-market fit signals. Decide: persist, pivot, or kill. Assess team dynamics. Consider ethical implications of your AI use. | Emotional attachment to "your baby." Survivorship bias from case studies. | "If I were advising a friend in this exact situation, what would I tell them?" |
| Grit Expression | Persistence through rejection (investors, customers, co-founders). Identity resilience when your startup *is* your identity. | Risk of "founder depression." Must build personal support systems. | "Am I persisting because of evidence, or because quitting feels like failure?" |

### Track B: AI Intrapreneurship Playbook

| CART Stage | Key Actions | Unique Constraints | Key Questions |
|------------|-------------|-------------------|---------------|
| Curiosity | Map internal pain points. Interview colleagues across departments. Audit existing workflows for AI augmentation opportunities. Study what competitors are doing with AI. | Bounded by organizational scope; curiosity must connect to business priorities. | "Where is my organization wasting the most time, money, or talent on tasks AI could handle?" |
| Agency | Build a business case. Find an executive sponsor. Assemble a cross-functional working group. Run a pilot with existing data and tools. | Must navigate hierarchy, politics, and competing priorities. Agency = persuasion + coalition-building. | "Who has the authority to say yes, and what do they need to see?" |
| Resourceful Experimentation | Prototype using company data (with permission). Run A/B tests within existing processes. Measure against existing KPIs. | Organizational risk aversion; compliance, security, and legal review. Experiments must be reversible. | "Can I run this experiment without asking permission, or do I need a sponsor?" |
| Thoughtful Judgment | Evaluate results against business objectives and employee impact. Consider change management implications. Assess scalability. | Organizational incentives may not reward innovation; judgment must include political feasibility. | "Even if this works technically, will the organization adopt it? What would need to change?" |
| Grit Expression | Persistence through bureaucratic inertia, budget cycles, and organizational "antibodies" that resist change. | Risk of career stagnation if innovation fails; must manage upward. | "Am I being strategically persistent or just annoying my colleagues?" |

### Bridging Exercise for Students

Have students work the same problem through both lenses. Example prompt:

> "A mid-size retailer is losing customers to online competitors. AI-powered personalization could help. Design a response as (a) an external startup selling to this retailer, and (b) an internal innovation team within this retailer. How does your approach differ at each CART stage?"

This exercise reveals that the same CART traits manifest very differently depending on context, which is the whole point of the dual-track design.

## 7. Four-Week Syllabus Sketch

### Course Context

A 4-week module within a broader business course (e.g., "Innovation and Technology Management" or "Entrepreneurship in the AI Era"). Assumes 2 sessions per week, 75 minutes each. Mixed undergraduate/MBA audience.

---

### Week 1: Foundations — Why Traits Matter More Than IQ in the AI Era

**Learning Objectives:** Students can (1) articulate why non-cognitive traits predict entrepreneurial success beyond a threshold IQ, (2) self-assess their Grit-CART profile, (3) distinguish between productive and unproductive grit.

**Session 1: The Intelligence Threshold and What Comes After**
- *Pre-reading*: Duckworth, A. (2016), *Grit*, Chapters 1-3 (passion and perseverance). Khosla's original X post (provided in course materials).
- *In-class*: Lecture (20 min) on Threshold Theory and Big Five research. Interactive discussion: "Think of someone you know who is smart but unsuccessful, and someone less academically talented who is thriving. What explains the difference?"
- *Activity*: Complete the Grit-CART 10-question diagnostic (Section 5). Generate a personal radar chart. Share in small groups (optional).

**Session 2: Grit and Growth Mindset — The Foundation**
- *Pre-reading*: Credé, M., Tynan, M. C., & Harms, P. D. (2017). "Much Ado About Grit." *Journal of Research in Personality*, 73, 48-65. Dweck, C. (2015). ["Carol Dweck Revisits the Growth Mindset."](https://www.edweek.org/leadership/opinion-carol-dweck-revisits-the-growth-mindset/2015/09) *Education Week*. (Both sides of both constructs.)
- *In-class*: Debate format: "Is grit just conscientiousness rebranded?" (15 min student debate, then instructor synthesis). Mini-lecture (15 min) on growth mindset as the cognitive precondition for grit — why persistence is irrational under a fixed mindset. Introduce the Mueller & Dweck (1998) praise finding: one sentence of "you're smart" vs. "you worked hard" changed children's risk-taking, persistence, and even honesty. Discuss: What does this mean for how we talk about entrepreneurial talent?
- *Activity*: Students write a 1-page "Grit Narrative" — a time they persisted and it paid off, OR a time they persisted and should have quit. Include a reflection: "Did I hold a growth or fixed mindset during this experience? How did that affect my choices?"

**Deliverable**: Grit-CART self-assessment + Grit Narrative (submitted, not graded — formative only).

---

### Week 2: The CART Cycle in Action — Curiosity and Agency

**Learning Objectives:** Students can (1) practice structured curiosity through customer discovery, (2) exercise agency by taking action under uncertainty, (3) apply these in both entrepreneurship and intrapreneurship contexts.

**Session 3: Curiosity — From Browsing to Building**
- *Pre-reading*: Kashdan, T. (2009), *Curious?*, Chapters 1-2 (interest vs. deprivation curiosity). Ries, E. (2011), *The Lean Startup*, Chapter 5 (Build-Measure-Learn).
- *In-class*: Lecture (15 min) on types of curiosity and how to channel curiosity into problem identification. Demo: Using AI tools (ChatGPT, Perplexity, open-source models) for rapid market research.
- *Activity*: **Curiosity Sprint** — In pairs, students have 30 minutes to identify a real problem worth solving using AI. They must: (1) interview at least 2 people outside the classroom (can be via text/call), (2) use an AI tool to research the problem space, (3) articulate the problem in one sentence.

**Session 4: Agency — From Idea to Action in 72 Hours**
- *Pre-reading*: Sarasvathy, S. (2001). "Causation and Effectuation." *Academy of Management Review*. (The foundational effectuation paper — assign the first 10 pages.)
- *Case study*: AsideAI (from the Grok conversation — the three immigrant founders who pivoted five times). Analyze through the agency lens: What resources did they have? How did they create new ones?
- *Activity*: **72-Hour Agency Challenge** (begins in class, due before Session 5). Each pair must take one concrete action toward their identified problem: build a landing page, create a prototype with AI tools, talk to 5 potential customers, draft a pilot proposal for an existing company. The action must produce an artifact (screenshot, recording, document).

**Deliverable**: Curiosity Sprint write-up + 72-Hour Agency artifact.

### Week 3: The CART Cycle in Action — Experimentation and Judgment

**Learning Objectives:** Students can (1) design a structured experiment with a falsifiable hypothesis, (2) apply evaluative judgment to results including ethical analysis, (3) make a reasoned persist/pivot/stop decision.

**Session 5: Resourceful Experimentation — Small Bets, Fast Learning**
- *Pre-reading*: Sims, P. (2011), *Little Bets*, Chapters 1-3. One short reading on A/B testing methodology.
- *Case study*: Walmart AI supply chain optimization (from the Grok conversation) — intrapreneurship track. Pepper Content (from the Grok conversation) — entrepreneurship track. Analyze both through the experimentation lens.
- *Activity*: **Experiment Design Workshop**. Each team designs a 1-week experiment for their project. Must specify: (1) Hypothesis in "If...then..." format, (2) What they will measure, (3) What result would make them pivot, (4) Maximum cost/time budget (affordable loss), (5) Ethical considerations — who could be harmed?

**Session 6: Thoughtful Judgment — Evaluating Results and Making Hard Calls**
- *Pre-reading*: Stanovich, K. (2009), *What Intelligence Tests Miss*, Chapter 1. One article on AI ethics failures (e.g., a real-world case of biased AI deployment).
- *In-class*: Lecture (20 min) on cognitive biases that distort judgment: confirmation bias, sunk-cost fallacy, survivorship bias. Structured exercise: Present students with 3 fictional scenarios where an AI venture shows mixed results. Each team must make a persist/pivot/stop decision and defend it.
- *Activity*: **Ethics Audit**. Each team conducts a structured ethical analysis of their project using a stakeholder mapping framework: (1) Who benefits? (2) Who could be harmed? (3) What data are you using, and did the people who generated it consent? (4) What happens if your solution scales 100x? Does it still feel right?

**Deliverable**: Experiment design document + Ethics Audit.

### Week 4: Integration — Building Your Grit-CART Playbook

**Learning Objectives:** Students can (1) synthesize the full Grit-CART cycle, (2) create a personal development plan, (3) articulate the framework to others.

**Session 7: Dual-Track Workshop**
- *Pre-reading*: Pinchot, G. (1985), *Intrapreneuring*, Chapter 1. Alternatively, a contemporary article on corporate AI innovation labs.
- *Activity*: **Track Swap Exercise** (see Section 6 Bridging Exercise). Teams take their project and work it through both the entrepreneurship and intrapreneurship lenses. Present both versions in 5-minute pitches to the class. Class votes on which track is more viable for each project and discusses why.

**Session 8: Personal Playbook + Capstone Presentations**
- *In-class*: Re-take the Grit-CART diagnostic. Compare with Week 1 baseline. Discuss: What changed? What was surprising?
- *Activity*: Each student writes a **Personal Grit-CART Playbook** (2-3 pages): (1) Their CART profile — strengths and development areas, (2) One specific 90-day goal where they will apply the framework, (3) Their personal "grit strategy" — what will they do when they want to quit? (4) Their "quit criteria" — under what conditions would stopping be the right call? (5) Two people who will hold them accountable.
- *Capstone*: Teams present their project journey through the CART cycle. Not a startup pitch — a learning reflection. What worked? What surprised them? Where did they need grit?

**Deliverable**: Personal Grit-CART Playbook + Team capstone presentation.

## Summary of Changes from Grit-CART 1.0 to 2.0

| Dimension | Version 1.0 | Version 2.0 |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| **Structure** | Linear sequence C→A→R→T | Iterative cycle with re-entry |
| **Grit role** | Vague "engine" metaphor | Two defined sub-processes (sustained engagement + adaptive persistence) operating at each stage, with explicit quit criteria. **Growth mindset** added as cognitive precondition |
| **Terminology** | Risk-Taking, Taste | Resourceful Experimentation, Thoughtful Judgment (clearer, more actionable) |
| **Scope** | Individual traits only | Three-layer model: Traits (core) + Capabilities + Relationships + Context |
| **Ethics** | Subsumed under "Taste" | Standalone capability with stakeholder analysis framework |
| **Teams** | Absent | Relational layer with complementary CART profiles, mentorship, networks |
| **Measurability** | None | 4-level rubric per dimension + 10-item quick diagnostic + pre/post design |
| **Dual-track** | Mentioned but undeveloped | Distinct playbooks with shared core + bridging exercise |
| **Happiness** | Referenced via SDT | Preserved; SDT's three needs (autonomy, competence, relatedness) now each have a structural home |
| **Teachability** | Framework only | Full 4-week syllabus with readings, activities, deliverables, and assessment |

## Final Note: What This Framework Is and Is Not

**Grit-CART 2.0 is** a pedagogical framework for developing entrepreneurial and intrapreneurial dispositions in the AI era. It is designed for classroom use, grounded in behavioral science, and honest about structural realities.

**Grit-CART 2.0 is not** a substitute for business strategy, technical training, or domain expertise. It does not promise that the right mindset guarantees success — it promises that without these dispositions, technical skill and opportunity are less likely to translate into sustained, meaningful action.

The framework's deepest insight — carried over from Version 1.0 and worth preserving — is this: **In a world where AI commoditizes intelligence, the scarce resources are human ones — sustained curiosity, the will to act, the courage to experiment, and the wisdom to judge well.** These can be taught, practiced, and developed. That is what makes Grit-CART worth teaching.
