## The Grit-CART Framework

**Grit-CART** is a dispositional toolkit for AI-era entrepreneurship and intrapreneurship education. In a world where AI commoditizes intelligence, the scarce resources are human ones — sustained curiosity, the will to act, the courage to experiment, and the wisdom to judge well.

It started with [a tweet](https://x.com/vkhosla/status/2022887136803029331), became [a Grok conversation](https://x.com/i/grok/share/5c6e617391a14f59a8551d749ab7060c), and was then rigorously evaluated by five parallel AI agents — each with a different critical lens — in a single afternoon session.

### The CART Traits

Four traits form an iterative cycle, with **Grit** (sustained engagement + adaptive persistence) as the engine that drives repeated passes through the loop:

| Trait | What It Means | Research Basis | Key Question |
|-------|---------------|----------------|--------------|
| **C**uriosity | Actively exploring problems and adjacent domains | Kashdan's curiosity dimensions, Big Five openness | *What don't I know? What could exist?* |
| **A**gency | Taking action and marshaling resources under uncertainty | Self-determination theory (autonomy), effectuation | *What can I do about it right now?* |
| **R**esourceful Experimentation | Running structured experiments with bounded downside | Lean Startup, Sarasvathy's affordable loss principle | *What small bet can I test cheaply?* |
| **T**houghtful Judgment | Evaluating results honestly, including ethical implications | Stanovich's rational thinking, critical thinking literature | *What did I learn? Should I persist, pivot, or stop?* |

**Growth mindset** (Dweck) serves as the cognitive precondition — persistence only makes sense if you believe effort leads to improvement.

### What Makes It Different

| Existing Framework | Focus | Grit-CART Adds... |
|--------------------|-------|-------------------|
| Lean Startup | Build-Measure-Learn cycle for ventures | Psychological readiness *before* the cycle begins |
| Effectuation (Sarasvathy) | Means-based reasoning under uncertainty | Explicit trait development + well-being |
| Design Thinking | Empathy-driven problem solving | Agency, risk tolerance, and long-term persistence |
| Entrepreneurial Mindset (NFTE/ICE) | Opportunity recognition | Theoretical depth via behavioral science |

### Four-Layer Ecosystem

The [strengthened framework (CART 2.0)](evaluations/05-strengthened-framework.md) extends individual traits into a four-layer model:

```
Context          Market conditions, AI infrastructure, regulatory environment
  └─ Relationships   Teams, mentors, networks, peer accountability
       └─ Capabilities   AI literacy, business fundamentals, ethical reasoning
            └─ CART + Grit   Individual dispositions (the core cycle)
```

The dual-track design applies the same CART cycle to both **entrepreneurship** (founding new ventures) and **intrapreneurship** (innovating within existing organizations) — acknowledging that most students will enter existing organizations, not start companies.

### Source Material

### Five-Agent Critical Evaluation
Each agent ran independently with web research access, conducting ~50 searches total across 74 unique sources (41 peer-reviewed):

| # | Evaluation | Focus |
|---|-----------|-------|
| 1 | [Theoretical Rigor](evaluations/01-theoretical-rigor.md) | Fact-checking empirical claims, verifying effect sizes, identifying cherry-picked evidence |
| 2 | [Pedagogical Value](evaluations/02-pedagogical-value.md) | Teachability, case study quality, comparison to established frameworks |
| 3 | [Practical Applicability](evaluations/03-practical-applicability.md) | AI market reality check, startup/intrapreneur failure modes, actionability |
| 4 | [Blind Spots & Biases](evaluations/04-blind-spots-biases.md) | Individualism bias, cultural assumptions, gender, neurodiversity, toxic positivity |
| 5 | [Strengthened Framework (CART 2.0)](evaluations/05-strengthened-framework.md) | Redesigned cyclical model, four-layer ecosystem, rubrics, 4-week syllabus |

### Synthesis & Research
- **[Critical Evaluation Synthesis](evaluations/critical-evaluation-synthesis.md)** — Cross-agent findings and unanimous conclusions
- **[Growth Mindset Research Notes](growth-mindset-grit-research-notes.md)** — Deep dive into Dweck-Duckworth collaboration, triggered by a human-in-the-loop observation

### Articles
- **[From Tweet to Treatise](articles/2026-02-15-from-tweet-to-treatise.md)** — The Hybrid Builder newsletter article describing the entire research process
- **[The Universal Paste Pattern](articles/2026-02-15-universal-paste-pattern.md)** — Meta-article on cross-platform publishing automation discovered during this project

## The Process

```
Khosla tweet → Grok conversation → Chrome extraction → 5 parallel agent evaluations
    → synthesis → human notices gap → 6th agent (growth mindset) → integration → article
```

Total active research time: ~30 minutes. Output: ~31,500 words across 8 documents.

## Session Transcript

This project was built during a live collaboration session with Claude.
