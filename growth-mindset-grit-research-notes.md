## 1. Dweck-Duckworth Collaboration: What They Found Together

### Direct Collaborations

Dweck and Duckworth have **not co-authored extensively as a pair**, but they are connected through a critical intermediary: **David Scott Yeager**, who has co-authored major publications with both and has served as the bridge between the mindset and grit research programs. The most important collaborative work includes:

**Yeager, Carroll, Buontempo, Cimpian, Woody, Crosnoe, Muller, Murray, Mhatre, Kersting, Hulleman, Kudym, Murphy, Duckworth, Walton, & Dweck (2022).** "Teacher Mindsets Help Explain Where a Growth-Mindset Intervention Does and Doesn't Work." *Psychological Science*, 33(1), 18-32.
- URL: https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/09567976211028984
- PMC: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8985222/
- **This is the key paper where Duckworth and Dweck are both co-authors.** It analyzes data from the National Study of Learning Mindsets (NSLM, N=12,490).
- **Key finding**: Growth mindset interventions only improved student grades when teachers themselves endorsed growth mindset beliefs. With growth-mindset teachers (+1 SD), the intervention produced a 0.11 grade-point improvement (p < .001). With fixed-mindset teachers (-1 SD), the effect was -0.02 and nonsignificant.
- Students with initially fixed mindsets benefited most when paired with growth-mindset teachers (0.16 grade-point gain).
- **Implication for Grit-CART**: The *instructor's mindset* is not a background variable -- it is a moderating condition for whether student-facing interventions work at all.

**Yeager, Hanselman, Walton, Murray, Crosnoe, Muller, ... Duckworth, ... Dweck (2019).** "A National Experiment Reveals Where a Growth Mindset Improves Achievement." *Nature*, 573, 364-369.
- URL: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1466-y
- The landmark Nature study. Both Duckworth and Dweck are co-authors.
- N = 12,490 ninth-graders across 65 nationally representative US schools.
- **Key finding**: A brief (<1 hour) online growth-mindset intervention improved grades among lower-achieving students by 0.10 grade points and reduced the rate of D/F grades by 5 percentage points. It also increased enrollment in advanced math by 3 percentage points.
- **Critical moderator**: Effects appeared primarily in schools where peer norms supported challenge-seeking behavior.

### Duckworth-Yeager Collaboration (Without Dweck)

**Duckworth, A.L. & Yeager, D.S. (2015).** "Measurement Matters: Assessing Personal Qualities Other Than Cognitive Ability for Educational Purposes." *Educational Researcher*, 44(4), 237-251.
- URL: https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.3102/0013189x15584327
- PMC: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4849415/
- Addresses challenges of measuring noncognitive factors (self-control, grit, growth mindset) for educational policy.
- Identifies "reference bias" as a major problem: different groups use different internal standards when self-reporting traits like grit.
- **Implication for Grit-CART**: Self-report measures of CART traits will be unreliable across student populations. Need behavioral measures or performance tasks, not just surveys.

### Dweck-Yeager Collaboration (Without Duckworth)

**Yeager, D.S. & Dweck, C.S. (2012).** "Mindsets That Promote Resilience: When Students Believe That Personal Characteristics Can Be Developed." *Educational Psychologist*, 47(4), 302-314.
- URL: https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00461520.2012.722805
- This is the foundational theoretical paper arguing growth mindset promotes resilience.
- Students who believe intellectual abilities can be developed show higher achievement across school transitions and greater course completion rates.
- Extends to social attributes: believing social skills are malleable reduces aggression and stress from peer victimization.

**Dweck, C.S. & Yeager, D.S. (2019).** "Mindsets: A View From Two Eras." *Perspectives on Psychological Science*, 14(3), 481-496.
- URL: https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1745691618804166
- PMC: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6594552/
- Dweck traces mindset theory from 1970s attribution research through modern intervention science.
- Proposes mindsets organize multiple psychological variables into integrated "meaning systems": goals, effort beliefs, attributions, and behavioral responses form a coherent package.
- Yeager describes how mindset research entered the era of pre-registered field experiments.
- **Key theoretical claim**: Fixed mindset creates a "meaning system" where effort signals low ability, failure means permanent inadequacy, and the rational response is to avoid challenge. Growth mindset creates an alternative system where effort is the *path* to ability, failure is informative, and challenge-seeking is rational.

## 2. Growth Mindset as a Mechanism for Building Grit

### The Theoretical Link

This is arguably the most important theoretical connection for the Grit-CART framework: **growth mindset may be a cognitive precondition for grit**. The logic:

1. **Grit requires sustained effort toward long-term goals** (Duckworth's definition).
2. **Sustained effort only makes sense if you believe effort leads to improvement** (Dweck's growth mindset).
3. If you hold a **fixed mindset**, effort signals that you lack talent, and persistence in the face of failure is irrational -- you are simply confirming your inadequacy.
4. If you hold a **growth mindset**, effort is the mechanism through which ability develops, and persistence through failure is the rational strategy.

Therefore: **Growth mindset provides the epistemic foundation that makes grit rational.** Without it, grit becomes either blind stubbornness or performative suffering.

### Empirical Evidence for the Link

**Park, D., Tsukayama, E., Yu, A., & Duckworth, A.L. (2020).** "The Development of Grit and Growth Mindset During Adolescence." *Journal of Experimental Child Psychology*, 198, 104889.
- URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022096519303017
- PMC: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8747892/
- Longitudinal study: N = 1,667 adolescents measured 4 times over 2 academic years.
- **Key finding**: Grit and growth mindset are **distinct but mutually reinforcing**.
  - Grit predicted rank-order increases in growth mindset (beta = .07, p < .01)
  - Growth mindset predicted rank-order increases in grit (beta = .03, p < .001)
  - **The effect of grit on mindset was about twice as large as mindset on grit.**
- Correlation between constructs: r = .18-.23 (moderate).
- **Two mechanisms identified**:
  - **Belief-to-behavior pathway**: Growth mindset encourages pursuing long-term goals with persistence (mindset fuels grit).
  - **Behavior-to-belief pathway**: Grit through deliberate practice produces "mastery experiences" that convince individuals hard work yields results, reinforcing growth-oriented beliefs (grit fuels mindset).

**2025 Meta-Analysis** (published in *Acta Psychologica*):
- URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001691825001854
- Overall correlation between growth mindset and grit: rho = .19
- Growth mindset and perseverance-of-effort facet: rho = .24
- Growth mindset and consistency-of-interests facet: rho = .20
- Individualistic vs. collectivist culture moderates the relationship (stronger in individualistic cultures).
- **Bottom line**: The relationship is real but moderate. Growth mindset and grit are related but not redundant. The perseverance facet (the better-validated half of grit) has the stronger link to growth mindset.

### What This Means for Grit-CART

Growth mindset is not just a nice complement to grit -- it is a **necessary enabling belief**. If a student holds a fixed mindset about the CART traits (e.g., "I'm just not a risk-taker," "I don't have good taste," "Some people are naturally curious and I'm not"), then telling them to "be gritty" about developing those traits is self-defeating. They need to first believe that curiosity, agency, risk-tolerance, and judgment are *developable* before grit makes sense as a strategy.

**Proposed theoretical model**:
```
Growth Mindset --> Grit --> CART Development --> AI Entrepreneurial Outcomes
     ^                            |
     |                            |
     +--- mastery experiences ----+
```

## 3. Replication Concerns: The Honest Empirical Picture

### What the Critics Found

**Sisk, V.F., Burgoyne, A.P., Sun, J., Butler, J.L., & Macnamara, B.N. (2018).** "To What Extent and Under Which Circumstances Are Growth Mind-Sets Important to Academic Achievement? Two Meta-Analyses." *Psychological Science*, 29(4), 549-571.
- URL: https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0956797617739704
- **Meta-Analysis 1** (correlation between mindset and achievement): k = 273, N = 365,915. Overall effect: **mindset accounted for ~1% of the variance in academic achievement** (r roughly .10). Weak overall.
- **Meta-Analysis 2** (intervention effects): Overall effect of growth mindset interventions was **small** (d ~ 0.08). Some support for effects on at-risk students.
- **Verdict**: The relationship between mindset and achievement is real but much smaller than popular accounts suggest.

**Macnamara, B.N. & Burgoyne, A.P. (2023).** "Do Growth Mindset Interventions Impact Students' Academic Achievement? A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis." *Psychological Bulletin*, 149(3-4), 133-173.
- URL: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36326645/
- k = 63 studies, N = 97,672 participants.
- Overall effect: **d = 0.05** (tiny).
- Found "major shortcomings in study design, analysis, and reporting, with evidence of researcher and publication bias."
- Among studies that verified the intervention actually changed students' mindsets (only 13 studies), the effect was d = 0.04 (nonsignificant).
- **No theoretically meaningful moderators were significant** in their analysis.

**Burnette, J.L., et al. (2023).** "A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Growth Mindset Interventions: For Whom, How, and Why Might Such Interventions Work?" *Psychological Bulletin*, 149(3-4), 174-205.
- URL: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36227318/
- Used modern multilevel meta-regression methods (vs. Macnamara's traditional approach).
- **Focal finding**: When analyses targeted at-risk subsamples and high-fidelity implementations:
  - Academic achievement: **d = 0.14** [95% CI: .06, .22]
  - Mental health outcomes: **d = 0.32** [95% CI: .10, .54]
- 95% prediction intervals ranged from -0.08 to 0.35 for academics.
- **Verdict**: Effects are real but heterogeneous. They emerge for specific populations under specific conditions.

### What the Proponents Argue Back

**Yeager, D.S., et al. (2022 commentary in Psychological Bulletin):** "Why Meta-Analyses of Growth Mindset and Other Interventions Should Follow Best Practices for Examining Heterogeneity."
- PMC: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10495100/
- Argues Macnamara & Burgoyne's approach obscures meaningful variation by treating all studies as testing the same hypothesis.
- Re-analysis of Macnamara's dataset using Burnette's methods confirmed meaningful effects for at-risk groups.
- Key argument: Averaging across all students (including those who don't need the intervention) dilutes effects.

**Yeager, D.S., et al. (2019, Nature)** -- the strongest single piece of evidence:
- Pre-registered, nationally representative, independently analyzed by MDRC and ICF International.
- Met Pashler & Ruiter's "Class 1" threshold for strong scientific claims.
- Effect size for lower-achieving students: **0.10 SD overall; 0.18 SD in supportive peer climates; 0.25 SD in math/science in supportive climates.**
- Authors estimate this would prevent ~90,000 at-risk students per year nationally from receiving D/F grades.

### How to Benchmark These Effect Sizes

From **Yeager et al. (2021)**, "What Can Be Learned from Growth Mindset Controversies?":
- PMC: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8299535/
- An exceptional vs. below-average teacher for one year: 0.16 SD
- One year of high school math learning: 0.22 SD
- Class size reduction: 0.20 SD
- Federal Innovation Fund (i3) interventions (median): 0.03 SD; 90th percentile: 0.23 SD
- **A brief, free, online intervention producing 0.10-0.25 SD effects is cost-effective**, even if the effect is "small" by Cohen's traditional benchmarks.

### Honest Summary: The Current Empirical Status

| Claim | Evidence Status | Confidence |
|-------|----------------|------------|
| Growth mindset correlates with academic achievement | Yes, but weakly (r ~ .10, ~1% variance) | Moderate -- real but small |
| Growth mindset interventions improve grades | Yes, for at-risk students in supportive contexts (d = 0.10-0.25) | Moderate-High for targeted populations |
| Growth mindset interventions work for everyone | No. Effects are near-zero for already-successful students | Low -- oversold claim |
| Context matters (peers, teachers) | Strongly supported by NSLM and follow-up studies | High |
| Brief online interventions are sufficient | Sometimes, when combined with supportive context | Moderate |
| Growth mindset is the meaning system described by Dweck | Correlational evidence supports the package (effort beliefs, goals, attributions correlate r = .17-.47 with mindset) | Moderate-High for the theoretical model |
| Growth mindset predicts grit | Yes, bidirectionally, with small-to-moderate effects (r = .19-.24) | Moderate |

### What Dweck Herself Acknowledges

In her 2015 "Growth Mindset Revisited" article (Education Week):
- URL: https://www.edweek.org/leadership/opinion-carol-dweck-revisits-the-growth-mindset/2015/09
- Acknowledged "false growth mindset" -- educators who claim the identity without changing practice.
- Admitted original work may have "put too much emphasis on sheer effort."
- Clarified: effort alone is not enough; **students need effective strategies and help from others**.
- Everyone is a **mixture** of fixed and growth mindsets; it is not a binary.
- Warned against using mindset measures for accountability, which would incentivize performative growth mindset.

## 4. Growth Mindset at Each CART Stage

### Curiosity + Growth Mindset

**Theoretical connection**: Curiosity (especially Kashdan's "joyous exploration" type) requires willingness to encounter novelty and uncertainty. A fixed mindset makes novelty threatening -- new domains expose potential incompetence. A growth mindset makes novelty inviting -- new domains are opportunities to learn.

**Evidence**:
- Dweck's meaning-system model shows growth-mindset students adopt **mastery goals** (learning-oriented) over **performance goals** (validation-seeking). Mastery goals drive exploratory behavior.
- Students with growth mindsets "more willingly pursue challenging remedial coursework despite acknowledged deficits" (Dweck & Yeager, 2019).
- Early research by Dweck showed children with growth mindsets chose harder puzzles and more challenging tasks after initial success, while fixed-mindset children chose easy tasks to protect their reputation.

**Practical implication for CART teaching**: Before teaching curiosity skills, establish the belief that *it is okay to not know things*. Fixed-mindset students avoid asking questions because questions reveal ignorance. Growth-mindset students see questions as tools. Frame curiosity not as a trait ("some people are naturally curious") but as a practice ("curiosity is a skill you build by asking better questions").

### Agency + Growth Mindset

**Theoretical connection**: Agency requires believing your actions matter -- that effort and initiative can change outcomes. This is precisely the growth mindset claim about ability. Fixed mindset undermines agency by suggesting outcomes are predetermined by talent.

**Evidence**:
- SDT (Deci & Ryan) shows autonomy and competence drive volitional action. Growth mindset supports both: believing you can develop competence encourages you to take autonomous action.
- Duckworth's "situational agency" concept shows gritty people intentionally modify their environments to support persistence. This requires believing environmental shaping works -- a growth-oriented assumption.
- Yeager & Dweck (2012) found growth-mindset beliefs promoted resilience across school transitions, enabling students to take initiative rather than becoming passive.

**Practical implication for CART teaching**: When students say "I'm not the kind of person who takes initiative" or "I don't have the personality for leadership," this is a fixed-mindset belief about agency. Counter with evidence that agency is built through small actions that compound. Provide scaffolded agency exercises (e.g., "build one thing this week, ship it to 5 people") that create mastery experiences.

### Risk-Taking + Growth Mindset

**Theoretical connection**: This may be the **strongest** link. Risk-taking requires tolerance for failure. Fixed mindset makes failure catastrophic (it confirms permanent inadequacy). Growth mindset makes failure informational (it reveals what to work on next).

**Evidence**:
- **Mueller & Dweck (1998)**: The landmark praise study. 128 fifth-graders given intelligence praise ("You must be smart") vs. effort praise ("You must have worked hard"). Results:
  - 67% of intelligence-praised children chose easy tasks afterward; majority of effort-praised children chose challenging tasks.
  - After experiencing failure, intelligence-praised children showed less persistence, less enjoyment, worse performance, and more low-ability attributions.
  - **This is the direct mechanism**: the type of implicit theory (fixed vs. growth) determines risk-taking behavior.
  - URL: https://cpb-us-w2.wpmucdn.com/web.sas.upenn.edu/dist/b/398/files/2019/04/1998-04530-003-1sagefw.pdf

- **Cimpian, Arce, Markman, & Dweck (2007)**: Even preschoolers (age 4) showed reduced persistence and risk-tolerance when given "generic" person praise ("you are a good drawer") vs. "nongeneric" process praise ("you did a good job drawing").
  - URL: https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-9280.2007.01896.x

- **Morris et al. (2023)** found that growth mindset training increased entrepreneurial action among necessity entrepreneurs by increasing their willingness to experiment and tolerate failure.
  - URL: https://sms.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/sej.1472

**Practical implication for CART teaching**: Risk-taking is the CART stage most directly affected by mindset. Before asking students to take entrepreneurial risks, inoculate them against the fixed-mindset interpretation of failure. Use explicit reframing: "If this experiment fails, what will you have learned?" not "If this experiment fails, what does it say about you?" Structure assignments with **expected failure** built in (e.g., "Your first three prototypes should be bad. Submit them anyway.").

### Taste/Judgment + Growth Mindset

**Theoretical connection**: Taste (discernment, judgment) requires openness to being wrong and willingness to revise your evaluations. A fixed mindset about judgment ("I have good instincts or I don't") prevents the iterative refinement that develops taste. A growth mindset about judgment ("my taste improves through exposure, critique, and practice") enables deliberate development.

**Evidence**:
- Stanovich's critical thinking research (cited in the CART framework) aligns: rational thinking is a skill that can be developed, not a fixed trait.
- Dweck's meaning-system model predicts that growth-mindset individuals are more likely to seek and use feedback, which is the primary mechanism for developing judgment.
- The "wise feedback" research (Yeager et al., 2014) showed that framing criticism as coming from high standards + belief in the student's capacity dramatically increased revision behavior -- the core mechanism for refining taste.

**Practical implication for CART teaching**: Taste is the hardest CART element to teach because it requires accumulated experience. Growth mindset enables the feedback-seeking behavior that accelerates taste development. Teach students to actively seek criticism (not just praise) of their AI products, business ideas, and design choices. Frame critique as "a sign that someone believes you can do better" (the wise-feedback model), not as "a sign that your judgment is bad."

## 5. Practical Classroom Implications for Teaching Grit-CART

### 5a. Process Praise vs. Person Praise (The Core Finding)

**Mueller & Dweck (1998)** and **Cimpian et al. (2007)** established that the type of praise students receive shapes their implicit theories, which in turn shape risk-taking, persistence, and challenge-seeking.

| Praise Type | Example | Effect on Mindset | Effect on Behavior |
|-------------|---------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Person/ability praise** | "You're so smart at AI" / "You're a natural entrepreneur" | Induces fixed mindset | Avoids challenge, low persistence after failure, performance goals |
| **Process/effort praise** | "I can see you iterated on that prompt 5 times -- that strategy is paying off" | Induces growth mindset | Seeks challenge, high persistence, mastery goals |
| **Generic praise** | "You're a good designer" | Induces entity theory (even in 4-year-olds) | Fragile self-concept, reduced risk-taking |
| **Nongeneric praise** | "You did a good job on that design" | Induces incremental theory | More robust self-concept, willing to try new approaches |

**Specific CART-relevant praise transformations**:

| Instead of... | Say... | CART Stage |
|---------------|--------|------------|
| "You have great intuition for this" | "Your questioning strategy helped you find that insight" | Curiosity |
| "You're a real go-getter" | "I noticed you took the initiative to reach out to three potential users -- that's effective agency" | Agency |
| "You're brave" | "Taking on that uncertainty was a smart move because it gave you information you couldn't get otherwise" | Risk-Taking |
| "You have great taste" | "Your judgment is getting sharper -- I can see you're applying the criteria we discussed" | Taste |

### 5b. Failure Framing Strategies

**Dweck's "Not Yet" concept**: A Chicago high school replaced failing grades with "Not Yet" -- signaling that the student is on a learning curve, not at a dead end. This reframing alone shifted student orientation from "I'm a failure" to "I'm in process."

**Wise Feedback (Yeager, Purdie-Vaughns, Garcia, Apfel, Brzustoski, Master, ... Cohen, 2014)**:
- URL: https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/xge-a0033906.pdf
- The formula: **High standards + belief in the student's capacity to meet them.**
- Example note: "I'm giving you these comments because I have very high standards and I know you can reach them."
- Results with 7th-graders:
  - 64% of African American students revised essays after wise feedback vs. 27% in control.
  - Long-term: Half as many disciplinary citations in 8th grade; higher college enrollment (64% vs. 45%).
- **Mechanism**: Wise feedback breaks the "cycle of mistrust" -- students who don't trust the institution interpret criticism as bias. Wise feedback restores trust by making the critic's belief in the student explicit.

**For Grit-CART specifically**: When students fail at CART activities (a prototype nobody wants, a pitch that falls flat, a risk that doesn't pay off), the instructor's response is the moment that either reinforces or undermines the framework. Use the wise-feedback formula:
- "This prototype didn't work, and that's exactly what's supposed to happen at this stage. Here's what I'd push you to try next, because I've seen your capacity to iterate." (Growth mindset + high standards + belief in capacity.)

### 5c. Dweck's Self-Correction on "Effort Praise"

In her 2015 revisited article, Dweck acknowledged that the growth mindset movement had been **oversimplified into "just praise effort"**:

> "We may have originally put too much emphasis on sheer effort."

The corrected view:
- **Effort alone is not enough**. Praising effort without results can feel patronizing ("Great effort!" when the work is clearly bad).
- Effective growth-mindset feedback praises **strategies, approaches, and help-seeking** -- not just effort.
- When students are stuck, the right response is NOT "just try harder" but "Let's talk about what you've tried, and what you can try next."
- **For Grit-CART**: This maps directly to the danger of telling students to "be grittier." Grit without strategy is just suffering. Growth mindset without strategic guidance is just optimism. The framework needs to emphasize *adaptive persistence* (trying different approaches) over *blind persistence* (grinding harder at the same failing approach).

### 5d. Instructor Mindset as Moderating Variable

The Yeager et al. (2022) study (the Duckworth-Dweck co-authored paper) demonstrated that **the instructor's own mindset moderates whether student mindset interventions work**:

- Growth-mindset teachers: student intervention produced 0.11 grade-point improvement.
- Fixed-mindset teachers: student intervention produced no significant effect (-0.02).
- Students with initially fixed mindsets benefited most from growth-mindset teachers (0.16 grade-point gain).

**For Grit-CART teaching**: If you are teaching the framework, your own mindset about the CART traits matters. Do you believe curiosity, agency, risk-tolerance, and taste are developable? Or do you implicitly believe some students "have it" and others don't? Students will detect the implicit theory even if the explicit messaging is growth-oriented. Dweck's concept of "false growth mindset" applies: claiming growth mindset while behaving as if traits are fixed will be transparent and counterproductive.

### 5e. Classroom Design Principles Derived from This Research

1. **Normalize failure as data, not identity.** Structure CART activities so that failure is expected, frequent, and low-stakes early. ("Your first three prototypes should be bad.")

2. **Use process praise, not person praise.** Comment on strategies, iterations, questions asked, and help sought -- not on talent, intelligence, or natural ability.

3. **Provide wise feedback on CART activities.** High standards + explicit belief in the student's capacity. Not "good job" and not "this is wrong" -- but "I'm pushing you because I know you can get there."

4. **Teach the growth mindset explicitly as a prerequisite for grit.** Before introducing grit as a concept, have students confront their beliefs about whether CART traits are fixed or developable. Use the Blackwell et al. (2007) approach: teach students about brain plasticity and skill development.

5. **Model your own growth mindset.** Share your own failures and iterations. Describe times you developed curiosity, agency, risk-tolerance, or taste through effort -- not times you were "naturally good" at something.

6. **Design peer environments that support challenge-seeking.** The NSLM (Nature, 2019) showed peer norms are a critical moderator. Create classroom cultures where asking for help, admitting confusion, and sharing failures are status-enhancing, not status-threatening.

7. **Don't use mindset for accountability.** Per Dweck's own warning, measuring and grading students on their mindset will produce "false growth mindsets" -- performative optimism rather than genuine belief change.

## 6. The Process Praise vs. Person Praise Finding: Deep Dive

### The Original Mueller & Dweck (1998) Study

**Citation**: Mueller, C.M. & Dweck, C.S. (1998). "Praise for Intelligence Can Undermine Children's Motivation and Performance." *Journal of Personality and Social Psychology*, 75(1), 33-52.
- URL: https://cpb-us-w2.wpmucdn.com/web.sas.upenn.edu/dist/b/398/files/2019/04/1998-04530-003-1sagefw.pdf

**Design**: Six studies with fifth-graders (ages 10-12, total N = 128 per study). Children solved 10 moderately difficult problems, then received one of three types of feedback:
- Intelligence praise: "You must be smart at these problems."
- Effort praise: "You must have worked really hard."
- Control: "You did really well."

**Findings across the six studies**:

1. **Challenge preference**: After praise, children chose between an easy task ("problems I'm pretty good at so I can show how smart I am") and a hard task ("problems I'll learn a lot from even if I won't look so smart"). **67% of intelligence-praised children chose the easy task. The vast majority of effort-praised children chose the hard task.**

2. **Enjoyment after difficulty**: When given much harder problems (designed to produce failure), intelligence-praised children reported significantly less enjoyment of the task.

3. **Persistence**: Intelligence-praised children showed less persistence on subsequent problems.

4. **Performance**: Intelligence-praised children's performance *decreased* on a final set of problems equivalent to the first set (which they had done well on). Effort-praised children's performance *increased*.

5. **Attributions**: Intelligence-praised children attributed failure to lack of ability ("I'm not smart enough"). Effort-praised children attributed failure to lack of effort ("I didn't try hard enough").

6. **Dishonesty**: When asked to report their scores to anonymous peers, **38% of intelligence-praised children inflated their scores**, compared to 13% in the effort condition. Person praise made children more likely to lie about performance.

### Why This Matters for Risk-Taking in CART

This is not a subtle finding. A single sentence of feedback -- "You must be smart" vs. "You must have worked hard" -- changed children's willingness to take on challenges, their resilience after failure, their actual performance, and even their honesty. The mechanism is clear:

- **Intelligence praise** activates a fixed-mindset meaning system: "My intelligence is being evaluated. If I take on a hard task and fail, I'll prove I'm not smart. Better to choose easy tasks and protect my reputation."
- **Effort praise** activates a growth-mindset meaning system: "My effort is being noticed. If I take on a hard task and fail, I just need to try harder or differently. I'll learn something either way."

**For Grit-CART risk-taking**: The risk-taking stage of CART is *precisely where this finding applies*. If instructors praise students' talent when their early ventures succeed ("You're a natural entrepreneur"), they may be inadvertently reducing those students' willingness to take future risks. The Mueller & Dweck finding predicts that talent-praised students will:
- Choose safer projects next time
- Enjoy the work less when it gets hard
- Give up faster when experiments fail
- Misrepresent results to protect their reputation

### The Cimpian Extension: Even Preschoolers

**Cimpian, A., Arce, H.M.C., Markman, E.M., & Dweck, C.S. (2007).** "Subtle Linguistic Cues Affect Children's Motivation." *Psychological Science*, 18(4), 314-316.
- URL: https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-9280.2007.01896.x

Found that even **4-year-olds** showed the same pattern: generic praise ("you are a good drawer") produced more fragile motivation than nongeneric praise ("you did a good job drawing"). This suggests the fixed/growth mindset response to praise is deeply ingrained and operates even before formal schooling.

### The Gunderson Longitudinal Extension

**Gunderson, E.A., Gripshover, S.J., Romero, C., Dweck, C.S., Goldin-Meadow, S., & Levine, S.C. (2013).** "Parent Praise to 1- to 3-Year-Olds Predicts Children's Motivational Frameworks 5 Years Later." *Child Development*, 84(5), 1526-1541.

- Process praise from parents at ages 1-3 predicted children's preference for challenge and incremental theories of intelligence at ages 7-8.
- **The effects of praise type persist for years.**

## Summary: What to Integrate into Grit-CART

### Strongest Evidence (High Confidence)

1. **Process praise > person praise for risk-taking and persistence** (Mueller & Dweck 1998; Cimpian et al. 2007). Well-replicated, large effects, directly relevant to CART.

2. **Growth mindset and grit are bidirectionally reinforcing** (Park et al. 2020). Longitudinal evidence with good sample size.

3. **Growth mindset interventions work for at-risk students in supportive contexts** (Yeager et al. 2019 Nature study; Burnette et al. 2023). Pre-registered, nationally representative, independently verified.

4. **Teacher/instructor mindset moderates intervention effects** (Yeager et al. 2022). Both Duckworth and Dweck co-authored this finding.

5. **Wise feedback (high standards + belief in student capacity) improves outcomes, especially for marginalized students** (Yeager et al. 2014). Randomized field experiments with long-term follow-up.

### Moderate Evidence (Use with Appropriate Caveats)

6. **Overall growth mindset-achievement correlation is small** (~1% variance; Sisk et al. 2018). Present this honestly -- growth mindset is not a magic bullet.

7. **Growth mindset interventions show near-zero overall effects when averaged across all students** (d = 0.05; Macnamara & Burgoyne 2023). The intervention is targeted, not universal.

8. **Growth mindset forms a coherent "meaning system"** with effort beliefs, goals, and attributions (Dweck & Yeager 2019). Theoretically compelling but based primarily on correlational evidence.

### Honest Caveats to Include When Teaching

- Growth mindset is **not a panacea**. It works primarily for students facing challenges, not those already succeeding.
- **Context matters enormously**: peer norms, teacher mindset, institutional culture all moderate effects.
- **Effort praise is necessary but not sufficient**. Students also need effective strategies, help-seeking skills, and structural support.
- Growth mindset can be **weaponized** ("If you just believed in yourself more, you'd succeed") in ways that ignore structural barriers. Pair with honest acknowledgment of systemic factors.
- The relationship between mindset and outcomes is **real but small** by traditional standards. It matters at scale and for cost-effectiveness, but it is not a transformation of individual destiny.
